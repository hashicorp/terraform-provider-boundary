# role_resource 
The role resource allows you to configure a Boundary role. 

## Example Usage
Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name             = "organization_one"
  description      = "My first scope!"
  scope_id         = "global" 
  auto_create_role = true
}

resource "boundary_role" "example" {
  name        = "My role"
  description = "My first role!"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

Usage with a user resource:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name             = "organization_one"
  description      = "My first scope!"
  scope_id         = "global" 
  auto_create_role = true
}

resource "boundary_user" "foo" {
  name     = "User 1"
  scope_id = boundary_scope.org.id
}

resource "boundary_user" "bar" {
  name     = "User 2"
  scope_id = boundary_scope.org.id
}

resource "boundary_role" "example" {
  name        = "My role"
  description = "My first role!"
  principals  = [boundary_user.foo.id, boundary_user.bar.id]
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}

```

Usage with user and grants resource:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name             = "organization_one"
  description      = "My first scope!"
  scope_id         = "global" 
  auto_create_role = true
}

resource "boundary_user" "readonly" {
  name        = "readonly"
  description = "A readonly user"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}

resource "boundary_role" "readonly" {
  name        = "readonly"
  description = "A readonly role"
  principals  = [boundary_user.readonly.id]
  grants      = ["id=*;action=read"]
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}
```

Usage for a project-specific role:

```hcl
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name             = "organization_one"
  description      = "My first scope!"
  scope_id         = "global" 
  auto_create_role = true
}

resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name             = "project_one"
  description      = "My first scope!"
  scope_id         = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_role = true
}

resource "boundary_user" "readonly" {
  name        = "readonly"
  description = "A readonly user"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.org.id
}

resource "boundary_role" "readonly" {
  name        = "readonly"
  description = "A readonly role"
  principals  = [boundary_user.readonly.id]
  grants      = ["id=*;action=read"]
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
}
```
