# boundary_scope (Data Source)

The scope data source allows you to discover an existing Boundary scope by name.
Please note that the Global scope will always have an id of "global", and does not need to be discovered with this data source.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```terraform
data "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name     = "SecOps"
  parent_scope_id = "global"
}

data "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name     = "2111"
  parent_scope_id = data.boundary_scope.id
}
```
