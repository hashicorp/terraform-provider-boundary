## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (String) You can specify that the filter should only return items that match.
Refer to [filter expressions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering) for more information.
- `list_token` (String) An opaque token that Boundary uses to continue an existing iteration or
request updated items. If you do not specify a token, pagination
starts from the beginning. To learn more about list pagination
in Boundary, refer to [list pagination](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/api-clients/api/pagination).
- `page_size` (Number) The maximum size of a page in this iteration.
If you do not set a page size, Boundary uses the configured default page size.
If the page_size is greater than the default page size configured,
Boundary truncates the page size to this number.
- `recursive` (Boolean)
- `scope_id` (String)

### Read-Only

- `est_item_count` (Number) An estimate at the total items available. This may change during pagination.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `items` (List of Object) The items returned in this page. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `removed_ids` (List of String) A list of item IDs that have been removed since they were returned
as part of a pagination. They should be dropped from any client cache.
This may contain items that are not known to the cache, if they were
created and deleted between listings.
- `response_type` (String) The type of response, either "delta" or "complete".
Delta signifies that this is part of a paginated result
or an update to a previously completed pagination.
Complete signifies that it is the last page.
- `sort_by` (String) The name of the field which the items are sorted by.
- `sort_dir` (String) The direction of the sort, either "asc" or "desc".
