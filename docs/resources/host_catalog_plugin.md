# boundary_host_catalog_plugin (Resource)

The host catalog resource allows you to configure a Boundary plugin-type host catalog. Host catalogs are always part of a project, so a project resource should be used inline or you should have the project ID in hand to successfully configure a host catalog.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name                     = "organization_one"
  description              = "My first scope!"
  scope_id                 = boundary_scope.global.id
  auto_create_admin_role   = true
  auto_create_default_role = true
}

resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name                   = "project_one"
  description            = "My first scope!"
  scope_id               = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_admin_role = true
}

resource "boundary_host_catalog_plugin" "aws_example" {
  name            = "My aws catalog"
  description     = "My first host catalog!"
  scope_id        = boundary_scope.project.id
  plugin_name     = "aws"
  attributes_json = jsonencode({ "region" = "us-east-1" })

  # recommended to pass in aws secrets using a file() or using environment variables
  # the secrets below must be generated in aws by creating a aws iam user with programmatic access
  secrets_json = jsonencode({
    "access_key_id"     = "aws_access_key_id_value",
    "secret_access_key" = "aws_secret_access_key_value"

  # the attributes below must be generated in azure by creating an ad application

    "tenant_id"                   = "ARM_TENANT_ID",
    "subscription_id"             = "ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID",
    "client_id"                   = "ARM_CLIENT_ID"
  })

  # recommended to pass in azure secrets using a file() or using environment variables
  # the secrets below must be generated in azure by creating an ad application
  secrets_json = jsonencode({
    "secret_value" = "ARM_CLIENT_SECRET"
  })
}

## Schema

### Required

- `scope_id` (String) The scope ID in which the resource is created.

### Optional

- `attributes_json` (String) The attributes for the host catalog. Either values encoded with the "jsonencode" function, pre-escaped JSON string, or a file:// or env:// path. Set to a string "null" or remove the block to clear all attributes in the host catalog.
- `description` (String) The host catalog description.
- `internal_force_update` (String) Internal only. Used to force update so that we can always check the value of secrets.
- `internal_hmac_used_for_secrets_config_hmac` (String) Internal only. The Boundary-provided HMAC used to calculate the current value of the HMAC'd config. Used for drift detection.
- `internal_secrets_config_hmac` (String) Internal only. HMAC of (serverSecretsHmac + config secrets). Used for proper secrets handling.
- `name` (String) The host catalog name. Defaults to the resource name.
- `plugin_id` (String) The ID of the plugin that should back the resource. This or plugin_name must be defined.
- `plugin_name` (String) The name of the plugin that should back the resource. This or plugin_id must be defined.
- `secrets_hmac` (String) The HMAC'd secrets value returned from the server.
- `secrets_json` (String, Sensitive) The secrets for the host catalog. Either values encoded with the "jsonencode" function, pre-escaped JSON string, or a file:// or env:// path. Set to a string "null" to clear any existing values. NOTE: Unlike "attributes_json", removing this block will NOT clear secrets from the host catalog; this allows injecting secrets for one call, then removing them for storage.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the host catalog.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import boundary_host_catalog_plugin.foo <my-id>
```
