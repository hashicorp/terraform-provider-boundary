# boundary_host_catalog_static (Resource)

The static host catalog resource allows you to configure a Boundary static-type host catalog. Host catalogs are always part of a project, so a project resource should be used inline or you should have the project ID in hand to successfully configure a host catalog.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "boundary_scope" "org" {
  name                     = "organization_one"
  description              = "My first scope!"
  scope_id                 = boundary_scope.global.id
  auto_create_admin_role   = true
  auto_create_default_role = true
}

resource "boundary_scope" "project" {
  name                   = "project_one"
  description            = "My first scope!"
  scope_id               = boundary_scope.org.id
  auto_create_admin_role = true
}

resource "boundary_host_catalog_static" "example" {
  name        = "My catalog"
  description = "My first host catalog!"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
}
```
